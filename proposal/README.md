_About Me_

I am Madhawa Gunasekara a master's student at University of Stuttgart.  I have good skills in Java, Maven, JUnit, JMS, AMQP, RDBMS, OData and other technologies of the Java Stack.
I am very passionate about integration frameworks. I studied about EIPs[https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/] as well.

In addition, I feel passionate about open source communities and have contributed to couple of projects. Every time, I learn something valuable and this is the way I find the best to give something in return and say thanks for that knowledge I have acquired.

Finally, I find GSoC the best way to establish connections and make lifelong friends that feel as passionate as I feel. I have participated before in GSoC. It was one of the best experiences that I could have had. I have full joy during the program. In fact, I never left the project I participated and I still stick around and try to solve some issues. After a while, I became an Apache committer. So, I will really appreciate if I can stay and learn more about Apache Camel and get to know that great community.
